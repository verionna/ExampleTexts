## PARAGRAPH 
```HTML
<p>Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. 
It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we 
  locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work.</p>
```
## **BOLD** AND *ITALIC* TEXT 
```HTML
The view of the earth from the moon fascinated <b>me a small disk, 240,000 mniles away</b>. 
It was hard to think that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all. 
But the samw wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were inhabited, 
then the destinies of all<i>who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined</i>. We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space. 
From out there it really is 'one world'.

## WHITE SPACE 
>White space collapsing is 
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
<br>
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

"I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is today. I’m convinced, however, that the true future of space travel does not lie with government agencies — NASA is still obsessed with the idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science — but real progress will come from private companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will receive the trickle-down benefits."

"We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."

It feeds on hard-shelled mollusks, crustaceans, sea urchins, and fish.<q>Identification of this species is very easy due to the pattern 
of harness-like markings that cross the eyes, run along the back to the first dorsal fin, then cross the side of the body,
